Description: This package is meant to assist in filling out your NCAA
    Tournament bracket. It includes functions that help you visualize both an
    individual team's performance over the season and two teams head-to-head.
    It also allows you to simulate a matchup based off of a custom "power" index
    given to each team based off of their performance over the season. You can
    decide from the probability of winning and their season stats your pick
    for each winner in the bracket. It also allows you to compare past years and
    any combination of tournament team you want since 2008!
